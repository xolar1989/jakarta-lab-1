                <p>The <span class="text--italic text--bold">Simple RPG</span> is a project created for the sake
                    of
                    providing some technological examples for students. The projects uses very simplified RPG
                    rules. Making those more advanced would lead to more complicated code therefore less
                    understandable example.</p>
                <p>This particular instance is not whole finished product. There is a number of applications
                    called <span class="text--italic text--bold">Simple RPG</span> focusing on different
                    technologies and
                    characterised by different levels of complication.</p>
                <p>If you would like to contribute in developing this and other examples (for example by
                    providing some nice graphics) please do not hesitate and contact author.</p>
